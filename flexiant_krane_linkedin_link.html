<meta property="og:description" content="Krane is an open-source platform that enables developers and sys admins to manage Docker instances across multiple clouds. Krane is built on the Docker code base, so supports the existing Docker command-line in a multi-cloud environment. This allows Docker users to use their existing workflows to launch apps transparently in multiple clouds, saving time and further reducing the friction of moving workloads between development, QA and production." />
